      <h2>About PEBL</h2>
	     <p>With its name meaning, "Powering Every Blockchain Leap", PEBL carries a bold and forward looking identity. It is a utility, collectible, and fungible token, 
        designed to power project use while holding lasting value for those who recognize its potential.</p>
         <br>
        <p> The supply of PEBL is permanently fixed - no additional minting, no burning and no dillution. This ensures true scarcity. Circulating freely among 
          collectors, holders and users, PEBL is built for long-term value preservation and recognition as a rare digital asset within the Cardano ecosystem.
